## Usage

>  From the root directory of this service, grab dependencies by running npm install. Then run npm start to get the server going on localhost:3000. Then run npm run react-dev to transpose the es6 files into a bundle using webpack. Start your mongodb by typing in mongod into the console. Next, npm run seed-db. This script will create a properties database with 3 tables (properties comparablehomes and localhomes), and then populate the three tables with 100 documents each.
